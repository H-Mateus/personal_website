Image credit: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/QZwf5yNopUo\"><strong>Unsplash</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n\n# 5) Relative links\n\nI can also include some relative links to, for example, tell you to check out this [other section of my site](/about)!\n\nThe structure of relative links is a bit confusing.\nWhen specifying the location of the page you want to get to, the reference point is the directory that your post lives in (and NOT the project root directory).\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nNow that I've migrated my site to use Quarto instead of RMarkdown, the relative links now work how you'd expect, which is very nice!\n:::\n\n# 6) Reading in data\n\nLet's flex our R muscles a little more by reading in some topical data, and making a fancier plot.\n\nThe data is total non-COVID-19 excess deaths per 100,000 and deaths involving COVID-19 per 100,000 for each 10-year age group from England and Wales, Week 11 to Week 18.\nThe numbers around COVID-19 as in constant flux, so please be aware of the date.\nThis data was downloaded from the Office of National Statistics on 2020-06-05.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ncovid_deaths <- read_csv(\"covid_deaths_by_age_2020-06-05.csv\")\n# let's select the rows of actual data\ncovid_deaths_filtered <- covid_deaths[7:16, ]\n# set column names\nnames(covid_deaths_filtered) <- c(\n  \"age_group\",\n  \"non-covid_excess_mortality\",\n  \"covid_excess_mortality\"\n)\n# convert to long-format dataframe\ncovid_deaths_long <- pivot_longer(\n  covid_deaths_filtered,\n  -age_group,\n

{.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you're curious about explanations surrounding the increase in non-COVID-19 related deaths [this article](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/analysisofdeathregistrationsnotinvolvingcoronaviruscovid19englandandwales28december2019to1may2020/technicalannex) lists some theories.\n\nInterestingly, in the age groups up to 50 the non-COVID-19 death rate has declined slightly\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

numbers, the [Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents](https://www.rospa.com/leisure-safety/advice/lightning/) reports that 30-60 people are stuck by lightning each year.\n\nThe [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/annualmidyearpopulationestimates/mid2019) estimated the population in the UK to be 66,796,807 in mid-2019.\nSo if we take then high end of 60 lightning strikes, the odds of getting stuck by lightning in the UK is:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# stop scientific notation\noptions(scipen = 999)\n# calculate risk per 100,000\nrisk = (60 / 66796807) * 100000\n# print result\nprint(paste(\n  \"The incidence rate of lightning strikes per 100,000 = \",\n  round(risk, 5),\n  sep = \"\"\n))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"The incidence rate of lightning strikes per 100,000 = 0.08982\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo if we assume all humans are equally likely to get stuck by lightning in a given year, then it's several times more likely for a 0-9 year old to get stuck by lightning than die with COVID-19.\n\nI should stress that this isn't to make light of COVID-19, many people are dying, and no effort should be spared wherever this can be prevented.\nIf anything, this should highlight how damaging COVID-19 is with a relatively low fatality rate.\nThis pandemic could easily be even worse than it already is with more lethal pathogen behind it, and it is perfectly within the realm of possibility that the next pandemic, which is sadly inevitable, will star a deadlier disease.\nMy greatest hope is that we can use this event as a wakeup call to stop ignoring the scientists who have warned this would happen repeatedly, and prepare better to mitigate future pandemics.\n",
