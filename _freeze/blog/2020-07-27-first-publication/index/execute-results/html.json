Confused yet?) was for the [paper](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/neu.2019.6495) this publication follows on from and that I briefly touch on in my [previous post](../../2020-06-08-joint-cdt-conference-2020/).\n\nBoth of these papers are about prognostic modelling of spinal cord injury.\nThe rest of this post aims to summaries this work in a (hopefully) lay-friendly way, so even a non-academic can get the gist of things.\n\nI do this because my research, like the majority of science, is funded by the taxpayer, and so I feel the taxpayer should have access to the work for free and in a way that they can understand.\n\nAlso so I can continue my endless quest to procrastinate on my thesis, but that's a tad less romantic so let's not dwell on it.\n\n## So what's prognostic modelling anyway?\n\n![Artist rendition of me pretending to work. Except not really.

I wonder what drugs they gave it...

Fair warning, don't read that article if you're having a good day, it'll ruin it.\n\nAs a result of this I really don't have much of a gauge of how good I am at writing for a lay audience.\nSo I welcome any feedback you might have about my writing as I'm keen to improve!\n\nThanks for reading, and have one final celebratory .gif for the road\n\n![\\\\( ͡> ‿‿ ͡<)/ Image credit: [**Giphy**](https://giphy.com/gifs/Ge86XF8AVY1KE/links)](https://media.giphy.com/media/Ge86XF8AVY1KE/giphy.gif){#fig-celebrate}\n",
