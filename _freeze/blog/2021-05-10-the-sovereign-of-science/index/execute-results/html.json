Funding body (normally public or charity funds) awards grant to scientist/s\n2. Scientist/s conduct work and write it up to publish in a journal\n3. The work is review by other scientists, and ultimately published\n\nNow if you're paying attention you may be wondering:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>What value have the journals added to this process?</b></p>\n\nThe journal certainly wastes a lot of time for the authors, and in return they either lock the science behind a pay-wall where it can only be read by scientists if their institution pays thousands to millions for journal subscriptions, or the funding body, who already paid for the science to be done, has to pay a massive fee for people to actually be able to disseminate the research.\n\n# The role of the journals\n\n(ref:journals) Image credit: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/FPNnKfjcbNU)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:journals)](journals.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo you may be thinking this seems completely nonsensical.\nWe pay for science and then we pay again to read/publish.\nWell actually, it's even more stupid than that.\nFor you see, the journals have a strong bias against negative results.\n\nSo suppose you're a competent scientist.\nYou design a good experiment, carry out a statistically appropriate analysis of the data, and it turns out your data doesn't support your hypothesis.\nThat's great!\nAs a fellow scientist, I want to know about negative results just as much as positive ones.\nThis will stop me from wasting time and money pursing ideas that won't work.\nNegative results can also help further our understanding of the subject just as much as positive ones.\nWe can start investigating *why* it didn't do what you/we may have initially expected.\nExcept the journals won't publish your work because they think negative results aren't good clickbait.\n\n# The role of the funders\n\n(ref:funders) Image credit: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/5f1RsK-pyZQ)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:funders)](funders.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut you ***need*** to publish your results otherwise you won't be able to attract further funding and advance your career.\nThe funding bodies don't care that you've done a good piece of scientific research, they're much too lazy to actually read the work you do.\nThey'd rather just look at how many publications and citations you have.\nThat's much quicker after all, and you don't need any scientific or statistical knowledge to understand it either.\nSo you have no choice but to start massaging your data to try and find a positive result the journal will accept.\nA common form of this is often referred to as [P-Hacking](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106).[@head_extent_2015]\n\n# The role of universities\n\nSo where do the research institutes fit in?\nTheir sole motivation is to attract funding because they get a cut of the dosh, and it makes them look good.\nThey therefore also don't care about the quality of the science, and don't typically bother teaching their graduates the skills they need to do science well.\nMost importantly statistics, but also methodologies for reproducible research are either not taught at all, or taught in a single extremely token module that students will have completely forgotten by the time they graduate.\nBut they'll still be able to attract funding for research as a scientist so why would the university care?\n\nThere is simply no connection between the quality of a scientists work, and their success as a scientist.\nIf you understand the incentive structure scientists are subject to, it's obvious that science would end up being low quality and unreproducible.\n\n# A sad example\n\nBut maybe you're a real optimistic soul, and you think I'm being too cynical.\nAllow me to describe the most depressing moment of my PhD thus far.\nI'll be vague with some specifics to avoid anyone getting into trouble.\n\nSome time ago, I was attending a spinal cord injury (SCI) conference.\nThis was prior to COVID-19.\nThe last session of the last day was an open debate.\nThe leading experts in the field begun debating that state of the field.\nThey argued we had be doing the same thing for decades, mostly finding a million ways to grow neurons in a dish, very successfully I might add, but that this had not, and would never likely translate into anything resembling a therapy to treat SCI.\nTherefore, we needed to go back to basics, to better understand the pathophysiology of SCI, if we were even to make real progress.\n\nIt wasn't really a debate as they pretty much all agreed with each other.\nI certainly agreed, and still do.\nAt this point they started talking about specific approaches we could take as a field to achieve this.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>For me, this debate was the purest, most beautiful expression of science I had even seen.<br>\nIt was exciting.</b><br>\nBut then someone stood up and took the mic.</p>\n\nFrom their voice you tell they were annoyed.\nThis individual effectively expressed that these experts at the top of their field were being too negative.\nThat we had heard about all this \"amazing\" work during the conference, and that everything was fine as is, in spite of the total lack of any meaningful advances in the field for past several decades.\nAnd so the room was silenced, and the debate ended.\n\nMaybe you're wondering why the experts didn't try to reason with this individual.\nThe person obviously wasn't a scientist, they didn't offer any specific technical criticism.\nThey just didn't like the implication that the research done so far hadn't produced much of worth.\nSurely, all they needed to do was explain that our wish as scientists was to make meaningful progress, with the ultimate goal of helping patients as soon as possible?\n\nBut there was a good reason they couldn't talk back to this person.\nThis person was on the board for one of the main funding bodies in the field.\nThis was the most powerful person in the room.\nThis was the hand that feeds, and none of them would dare bite it for fear they'd never get another grant.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>This was our Sovereign.</b></p>\n\nThey had borne witness to the most wonderful expression of science I had ever seen and they hated it.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In this moment I realised something.<br>\nWe weren't scientists.<br>\nWe weren't here to expand the boundaries of human knowledge, to solve problems or to cure disease.<br>\nWe were clowns, here merely dance so that this idiot child could tell themselves that they were making a difference.</p>\n\nThe funding bodies are the most powerful players in science.\nIf they say jump, we'll jump.\nOtherwise we lose our job.\n\nSuggesting that scientists are to blame for this ridiculous system is nothing more than scapegoating.\nThis is very similar to how [manufactures have successfully shifted the burden\n](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled?t=1620643938203) of waste management onto the public, and [distracted them by pushing the lie of recycling](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/17/plastic-recycling-myth-what-really-happens-your-rubbish).\n\nThe \"reproducibility crisis\" is one of their making, and they should be the ones to solve it.\nOr at the very least, stop making it worse.\n\n# The personal cost of incompetent management\n\nThis problem has been on my mind a lot lately.\nAs a third year PhD student I've been thinking about what I'm going to do once I've submitted my thesis.\n\nI was in a very fortunate position as my supervisor had managed to secure some funding for me to carry on my research.\nMy current lab is small, but the people are both lovely on a personal level, and extremely supportive professionally as well.\nSadly, this isn't always a given.\nHaving worked in several labs I've seen some pretty callous and petty behaviour in other places.\nSo this offer was plenty tempting in a lot of ways.\n\nBut because of my burning contempt for the way science is done, I wasn't feeling particularly keen to stay in academia.\nWhat was the point?\nI have no interest in being a clown for these wretched, incompetent funding bodies for the rest of my life.\nTo constantly have to fight to justify my existence whilst they effectively demand I cast aside my integrity to appease them and progress in my career.\n\nAnd yet, I got this far because I firmly believe that science is one of the most important human endeavours.\nI'm also pretty sure I'm better at it than most scientists, though that's less me thinking I'm great, and more that the bar is so depressingly low.\n\nThrough all these thoughts, I was headhunted for a data science role as well.\nThe job seemed likely to be rather boring, but it offered better job security and probably more money in the long term, and freedom from \"publish or perish\".\nThe absurdity of current science made it seem pretty attractive to me.\nI wonder how much great young talent is lost from science due to these things.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>That may well be the greatest cost of all this stupidity.</b></p>\n\nAnd then I was offered a bioinformatics postdoc in the field of dementia at a Russle Group university.\nAfter much internal strife I've decided I'll give academia another chance.\nMaybe I'm just worn down by this pandemic, and the stress of my looming submission deadline.\nMaybe a bigger lab and a field with more funding will improve my perception.\nPerhaps the larger sums attract more competition and so standards of the funders are higher.\n\nI certainly hope so.\n\n# So what can be done?\n\nWell, writing this has made me sad, so I'm going to have a break now.\nOnce I've recharged, I'll aim to write a follow-up article exploring ideas for how science could be improved.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThat article has been written and can be found [here](../../../../post/how-might-science-be-done-better/)\n\n# References\n",
