Forget about it!\n\nAnd yes, I didn't forget that I got the Corne in the first place was because I liked the Kinesis... \nThe universe has an annoying sense of humour, and so further down the rabbit hole we go\n\n![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExcXpiYmY5dWhxaDV4cm9oamN0dDRlY3MyeWw2b3dibXFndWE3MTI2OCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/T1GWTCSrTr2tnsvq4k/giphy.gif)\n\nSomewhat reassuringly it turns out I was not the only one annoyed with the limitations of the Kinesis firmware, and the lovely [Michael Stapelberg](https://michael.stapelberg.ch/) made a super cool mod for the keyboard to solve it!\nThis mod involves swapping out the controller for the keyboard for one we can use with other, better (and open-source) firmware, such as [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/).\nMicheal designed the PCB for this and very helpfully lays out all the components you'll need for this in a wonderfully well-documented repo [here](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint), but importantly, you need to solder it all together yourself!\n\n![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExY3Z1cmNjMjRmM3hwcGN3MjRpOG80cHNkeWRvNHMwdWppYm85YXBtMyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/XhcSIUIkgbmuY/giphy.gif)\n\nAs a side note, it turns out some PCB manufacturers will actually do all this for you (for extra dosh of course), but I did not know this at the time because my ignorance is vast.\nEven if I had known I think I would've gone down the DIY route anyway, but still, the more you know I guess.\n\nNow I've never soldered before, but it seemed to be nice and beginner friendly project so I was down to try!\nThe issue being that I own no soldering equipment, and don't really have physical space in my flat to put any (and don't fancy spending loads of money building a whole setup!)😑\n\nBut then it occurred to be that there must be some sort of community space for this kind of equipment somewhere in Cardiff, and it turned out there is!\nPretty much the first hit on searching was the super cool [RemakerSpace](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/remakerspace), a not-for-profit that offers fancy 3D printing, industrial sewing machines and a well equipped soldering workshop.\nA few emails later and I got the okay to rock up and give it a bash😎\n\n![](index-img/250604-143405.avif)\n\nThe place is super well equipped, and I'm now presumably totally spoiled and will never be able to use less fancy equipment🤷\n\nThe planets were sadly not on side this time and so I wasn't diligent about taking pictures whilst doing this, but here's the unadorned PCB:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index-img/250604-143554.avif){width=49%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index-img/250604-143631.avif){width=49%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd here's the finished PCB in all it's glory:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index-img/250604-143715.avif){width=49%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index-img/250604-143747.avif){width=49%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI didn't burn myself, set anything on fire or die and I even had fun, so I regard it as a great success!\n\nI also had no way of knowing if I screwed anything up at the time since I didn't realise the controller board had a wretched micro-USB port, which I (obviously) didn't think to bring, and so chose to roll with unjustified confidence through it assuming it would work.\nSoldering the LEDs and resistors on the back was definitely the hardest bit as it's the most fiddly.\nI'm sure there were tools in there that could have helped (probably those funky helping hands on the multimeter in the pic of the setup above), but I was alone and was too shy to mess around with stuff too much😅\n\nNow it was just a case of removing the rubbish original board:\n\n![](index-img/250604-144540.avif)\n\nAnd installing the shiny new one without breaking the scary ribbon cables:\n\n![](index-img/250604-144842.avif){style='transform:rotate(270deg);'}\n\nAnd after some tense firmware flashing it worked!!!\n\n![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbGhzM3QxMHc5YTV2eWlndG4ybDI0dnR0a3VpNHc3YTIybDc4M25rbSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/VdiQKDAguhDSi37gn1/giphy.gif)\n\nTo perhaps little surprise it seems the LEDs don't actually work (maybe I installed them wrong way around😅), but who needs that junk anyway!\nThe only other issue I've noticed is that it takes a strangely long time to start working on my Mac from sleep, but it's only a few seconds so I don't much care and have been too lazy to investigate for now.\n\nFor the curious here's my current keymap on the [QMK configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/):\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index-img/250604-150052.avif){width=49%}\n:::\n\n:::

would highly recommend as a first soldering project to the 3 people this might be relevant for :P\n",
