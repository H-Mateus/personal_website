::: {#hero-heading}
<div class="h1">Hi!</div>

Thanks for stopping by!

I am a postdoctoral bioinformatician at the [UK Dementia Research Institute](https://ukdri.ac.uk/), [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/), I specialise in Alzheimer's disease with a vascular lens.
Learn more about my research interests in [publications](/publication).
I'm highly experienced in single-cell sequencing analysis and am passionate about advancing reproducible research practices.

I currently chair the Early Career Researcher (ECR) Informatics Committee and co-founded the [UK DRI's](https://ukdri.ac.uk/) Reproducibility Working Group following significant interest in my presentations on the topic.

## About me

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6 #about-me-1}

**Biologist turned informatician, passionate about improving research standards.**

I feel in love with [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) when I first learnt to code during my PhD, and rapidly learned there were objectively better ways of working that many researchers were oblivious too. This ignited a drive to fight to improve research practices, including educating colleagues and students. I've since gotten more involved in teaching, recieving the [Higher Education Associate Fellowship](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship) and teaching an introduction to R course for our bioinformatics Masters students at Cardiff University.

::: {.g-col-6 #about-me-2}

I completed my PhD in biomedical engineering at [Keele Univeristy](https://www.keele.ac.uk/research/) in 2021, where my research focused on biomarkers and prognosis of spinal cord injury.
I gained lots of experience working with electronic healthcare records and my first taste of omics in the form of proteomics.

I got my BSc in biological sciences from [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) in 2016, followed by an internship at the prestigious [Bionics institute](http://www.bionicsinstitute.org/) in Melbourne, Australia.
There, I contributed to groundbreaking research in viral gene therapy and optogenetics in the cochlea, working alongside an internationally renowned research team.
This experience involved comprehensive laboratory work including surgeries, tissue processing, immunohistochemistry, and microscopy, contributing to the development of next-generation cochlear implants.
