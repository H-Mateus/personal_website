intro: |
  As a postdoctoral bioinformatician at the [UK Dementia Research Institute](https://ukdri.ac.uk/), [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/), I specialise in Alzheimer's disease with a vascular lens.
  I'm highly experienced in single-cell sequencing analysis and am passionate about advancing reproducible research practices.

  I currently chair the Early Career Researcher (ECR) Informatics Committee and founded the [UK DRI's](https://ukdri.ac.uk/) Reproducibility Working Group following significant interest in my presentations on the topic.

  I completed my PhD in biomedical engineering at [Keele Univeristy](https://www.keele.ac.uk/research/) in 2021, where my research focused on biomarkers and prognosis of spinal cord injury.
  I gained lots of experience working with electronic healthcare records and my first taste of omics in the form of proteomics.
  During my doctoral studies at the Center for Doctoral Training (funded by EPSRC), I discovered my passion for programming and data science, developing strong competencies in Linux and computational analysis.

  My journey in biomedical research began with a BSc in biological sciences from [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) in 2016, followed by an internship at the prestigious [Bionics institute](http://www.bionicsinstitute.org/) in Melbourne, Australia.
  There, I contributed to groundbreaking research in viral gene therapy and optogenetics in the cochlea, working alongside an internationally renowned research team.
  This experience involved comprehensive laboratory work including surgeries, tissue processing, immunohistochemistry, and microscopy, contributing to the development of next-generation cochlear implants.
