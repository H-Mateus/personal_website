I am currently a PhD student at [Keele Univeristy](https://www.keele.ac.uk/research/). My research focuses on the prognosis of spinal cord injury. 
I have been investigating the value of blood paramaters measured as part of routine care in predicting the level of neurological recovery a patient may have.
I am also using proteomic techniques and ELISAs to further analyse patient blood to identify potential novel biomarkers that may predict recovery.

I graduated from the [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) in with a BSc in biological sciences in 2016. 
Upon completing my degree I obtained an internship at the [Bionics institute](http://www.bionicsinstitute.org/) in Melbourne, Australia. 
In my time there I have gained valuable research experience at a biomedical research institute working with an internationally renowned research team on gene therapy and optogenetics in the cochlea. 
I was able to complete a small project based on viral gene therapy in mice for optogenetics, which included surgeries, dissections, tissue processing, immunohistochemistry, microscopy, imaging and analysis. 
The early results are promising and contributes to laying the groundwork for creating a new generation of cochlear implant. 
This internship gave me an insight into cutting edge biomedical research that has helped me further develop my skills as a scientist.

During my PhD I have a new-found love of data science and a passion for R and Python.<br>
