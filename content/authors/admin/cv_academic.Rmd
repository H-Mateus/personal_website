### Research profile

Currently a final-year PhD student at Keele University based in the Spinal Studies group at The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord due to trauma, degeneration or disease that results in a temporary or permanent change to its neurological function, recovery from which is highly variable.
SCI can lead to devastating consequences for both the physical and mental health of patients, particularly due to the uncertainty of neurological outcomes in the first two weeks post-injury.
The variability of recovery has also stymied development of novel therapies as it makes powering clinical trials extremely difficult.

I endeavour to discover novel biomarkers of SCI outcomes, both to minimise this uncertainty and to expand our understanding of the underlying pathology of neurological recovery.
I use a combination of modelling historic patient data and proteomic techniques to this end, and have found evidence of a relationship between markers of liver health and SCI recovery.
I am currently validating our prior models with external datasets and seeking to carry out a metabolomics experiment to better elucidate the link between the liver and SCI.
