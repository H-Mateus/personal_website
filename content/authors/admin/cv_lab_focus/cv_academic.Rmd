### Research profile

Currently a final-year PhD student at Keele University based in the Spinal Studies group at The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord due to trauma, degeneration or disease that results in a temporary or permanent change to its neurological function, recovery from which is highly variable.
SCI can lead to devastating consequences for both the physical and mental health of patients, particularly due to the uncertainty of neurological outcomes in the first two weeks post-injury.
The variability of recovery has also stymied development of novel therapies as it makes powering clinical trials extremely difficult.

I endeavour to discover novel biomarkers of SCI outcomes, both to minimise this uncertainty and to expand our understanding of the underlying pathology of neurological recovery.
I use a combination of modelling historic patient data and proteomic techniques to this end, and have found evidence of a relationship between markers of liver health and SCI recovery.
I am currently validating our prior models with external datasets and seeking to carry out a metabolomics experiment to better elucidate the link between the liver and SCI.

The lab rotations in the first year of my PhD also allowed me to greatly develop my skills at the bench.
At Loughborough University, I investigated dynamic expression of functionally relevant genetic markers in adherent and non-adherent hydrogels, where I gained experience in 3D tissue culture, hydrogels and PCR.
At Nottingham University I studied the effects of alternating current on interfacing wires grown via wireless electrochemistry.
I optimised a new technique for fabricating a cellular-electrical bioelectronic system and gained experience in 3D printing, electrodeposition and microscopy.
At Keele University focused on a "lung on a chip" model, where I cultured multiple cell types in 3D constructs and compared viability and grow kinetics via cell staining, fluorescent microscopy and cell viability assays.
These experiences have given me a highly cross-disciplinary skillset making me a flexible and versatile scientist.
