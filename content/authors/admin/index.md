I am currently a Research Associate as a bioinformatician at the [Dementia Research Institute](https://ukdri.ac.uk/), [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/), working on Alzheimer's disease with a focus towards genomics.
I completed my PhD in biomedical engineering at [Keele Univeristy](https://www.keele.ac.uk/research/) in 2021, where my research focused on biomarkers and prognosis of spinal cord injury.

I graduated from the [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) in with a BSc in biological sciences in 2016.
Upon completing my degree I obtained an internship at the [Bionics institute](http://www.bionicsinstitute.org/) in Melbourne, Australia.
In my time there I gained valuable research experience at a biomedical research institute working with an internationally renowned research team on gene therapy and optogenetics in the cochlea.
I was able to complete a small project based on viral gene therapy in mice for optogenetics, which included surgeries, dissections, tissue processing, immunohistochemistry, microscopy, imaging and analysis.
The early results are promising and contributes to laying the groundwork for creating a new generation of cochlear implant.
This internship gave me an insight into cutting edge biomedical research that has helped me further develop my skills as a scientist.

I subsequently completed a PhD in regenerative medicine at the Center for doctoral training, funded by the EPSRC.
The experience greatly shaped my interests.
In particular I learnt to code as part of my research, and in doing so discovered a great love of programming, a fondness for Linux, and other skills related to data science.

You can see the files I made to create this website on my [Github](https://github.com/H-Mateus/personal_website).<br>
I'm also the author and maintainer of the [OsKOR website](https://oskor.netlify.app)<br>
