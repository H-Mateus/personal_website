<p>It’s been a while since my last post where I outlined <a href="../../../../post/how-might-science-be-done-better/">ideas for how science may be done better</a>.
In the interim I’ve submitting my PhD thesis and am impatiently awaiting my <em>viva</em> (where one defends their thesis to experts, which you need to pass to be awarded your PhD!).
I also started my new role as a <em>Research Associate</em> (the posh formal title for a Post-Doc) at the <a href="https://ukdri.ac.uk/">Dementia Research Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/">Cardiff University</a> which has been a good mix of exciting and terrifying.</p>
<p>But, I recently came across a really cool initiative that attempts to implement some of the ideas I explored in the <a href="../../../../post/how-might-science-be-done-better/">last post</a>, called the <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/">Peer Community in</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the above outline, the PCI works by inviting authors to first submit their papers to a preprint servers with their code and data.
Then the authors can submit their DOI to the PCI whereupon a member of the community can recommend the paper as worthy of review.
Then others in the community are invited to review the paper, and go through a typical peer-review process with new versions being updated on the preprint server.
Once the reviewers are happy that the paper is of sufficient quality they give the article a recommendation, which itself is a separate, citable document with a DOI.</p>
<p>At this stage the authors can submit their article to a <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/pci-friendly-journals/">PCI-friendly journal</a> which will typically accept the recommended paper without applying their own peer-review process.
The key benefit here is that the peer-review is divorced from the various biases a journal can bring to this process.
The PCI also have their own <a href="https://peercommunityjournal.org/">Peer Community Journal</a> which will always accept the recommendation and publish the article as open-access for free!</p>

<p>This last option of publishing with the Peer Community Journal is particularly appealing to me, especially at a time where other journals are exploiting their position to charge an outrageous open-access fee <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03324-y">of up to €9,500 ($11,500) per paper</a>.
I won’t rehash my rant outlining my feeling towards these parasitic journals, if you need a refresher though, that post can be <a href="../../../../post/the-sovereign-of-science/">found here</a>.</p>
<p>They also have a video explaining the process I’d recommend watching:</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>I will certainly support this model in my future work as much as I am able to, and encourage any of my peers to do the same.
I truly hope this model finds success as I firmly believe it will lead to fairer and better quality science.</p>
