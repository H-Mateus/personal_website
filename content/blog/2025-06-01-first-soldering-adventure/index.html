<p>So, Iâ€™ve gone down a bit of keyboard rabbit hole lately!</p>
<p>It started with me getting an unusual ergonomic keyboard in the form of a <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">Kinesis Advantage 2</a> after a friend recommended it.
This is a split keyboard with two concave keywells, but a picture will make more sense I suspect:</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250601-175823.avif" /></p>
<p>I wonâ€™t attempt to review this keyboard, but sufficed to say I liked it after a period of adjustment, and was happily using it for several months.
The issue arose when I started going into the office more often and became annoyed with the plebeian normal keyboard at work (BORING!).</p>
<p>I considered just getting another one, or maybe the newer wireless version from the same manufacturer, but theyâ€™re a little pricey and I had my curiosity peeked by the Corne keyboard.
The Corne is a columnar stagger 40% keyboard, with a PCB designed by the amazing <a href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd">Foostan</a> and it has become one of the most popular keyboards among the split community.</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250601-181452.avif" /></p>
<p>Itâ€™s even popular enough that there are some vendors that will sell you a pre-assembled Corne, but half the fun is being able to customise things to your fancy!
So I opted to get a kit that I could assemble myself, but I donâ€™t own any soldering equipment (more on that later), so I went for the pre-soldered board which effectively leaves you with a soldered PCB, the switches, keycaps and case of your choice to put together.</p>
<p>The planets must have been aligned in an unusual fashion because I actually had the wherewithal to take photos as I put it together:</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250601-182954.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250601-182934.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250601-182915.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250603-163412.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250603-163502.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250603-163553.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250603-163627.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250603-163657.avif" width="49%" /></p>
<p>Putting those switches in was most the stressful part as that has fears of breaking the plate if too forcefulâ€¦
I went with Kailh Choc Pro Reds for the curious, but Iâ€™m not switch connoisseur, so very open to other suggestions if you reckon something elseâ€™d be better!</p>
<p>I somehow succeeded without breaking anything (move evidence of strange planetary movementsðŸŒš) and the final result was pretty sweet I reckons!</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250603-163728.avif" /></p>
<p>After much time faffing with key mappings and a bit more practise with the new layout, Iâ€™ve ended up with a setup Iâ€™m really enjoying!</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250603-164353.avif" /></p>
<p>You can find my keymap config file <a href="https://github.com/H-Mateus/zmk-config-corne/blob/master/config/corne.keymap">here</a> if curious.
One aspect of the layout Iâ€™ve particularly liked was using <a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">homerow mods</a> and having an easy hyper key (âŒƒâŒ¥â‡§âŒ˜).</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the firmware you can flash on these keyboards is very versatile.
For example, it lets you have keys that can have one output if you tap the key, and another if you hold the key.
Homerow mods take advantage of this to let you use your home row keys as modifiers (âŒƒ, âŒ¥, â‡§, âŒ˜) when held.</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250603-170653.avif" /></p>
<p>The hyper key is just a very awkward series of keys to hold on a normal keyboard, and so no applications will use them as keybindings.
This opens up a whole world of possibilities to use in conjunction with hyper.
In my case Iâ€™m using them for window management on the Mac I use for work (I miss my Arch Linux machine from the PhD days ðŸ˜­).
Itâ€™s certainly not the same as having a proper <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Window_manager">window manager</a>, but it gets close enough (and yes Iâ€™ve tried <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai">Yabai</a>, I found it finicky).</p>
<p>But I digress, the issue this lovely keyboard caused was frustration with my Kinesis.
You see, whilst the hardware of the Kinesis is plenty nice, the firmware is infuriatingly limited.</p>
<p>To give just one example, one can only have two layers of keybindings on the Kinesis (donâ€™t ask me whyâ€¦).
And homerow mods? Forget about it!</p>
<p>And yes, I didnâ€™t forget that I got the Corne in the first place was because I liked the Kinesisâ€¦
The universe has an annoying sense of humour, and so further down the rabbit hole we go</p>
<p><img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExcXpiYmY5dWhxaDV4cm9oamN0dDRlY3MyeWw2b3dibXFndWE3MTI2OCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/T1GWTCSrTr2tnsvq4k/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>Somewhat reassuringly it turns out I was not the only one annoyed with the limitations of the Kinesis firmware, and the lovely <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/">Michael Stapelberg</a> made a super cool mod for the keyboard to solve it!
This mod involves swapping out the controller for the keyboard for one we can use with other, better (and open-source) firmware, such as <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/">QMK</a>.
Micheal designed the PCB for this and very helpfully lays out all the components youâ€™ll need for this in a wonderfully well-documented repo <a href="https://github.com/kinx-project/kint">here</a>, but importantly, you need to solder it all together yourself!</p>
<p><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExY3Z1cmNjMjRmM3hwcGN3MjRpOG80cHNkeWRvNHMwdWppYm85YXBtMyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/XhcSIUIkgbmuY/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>As a side note, it turns out some PCB manufacturers will actually do all this for you (for extra dosh of course), but I did not know this at the time because my ignorance is vast.
Even if I had known I think I wouldâ€™ve gone down the DIY route anyway, but still, the more you know I guess.</p>
<p>Now Iâ€™ve never soldered before, but it seemed to be nice and beginner friendly project so I was down to try!
The issue being that I own no soldering equipment, and donâ€™t really have physical space in my flat to put any (and donâ€™t fancy spending loads of money building a whole setup!)ðŸ˜‘</p>
<p>But then it occurred to be that there must be some sort of community space for this kind of equipment somewhere in Cardiff, and it turned out there is!
Pretty much the first hit on searching was the super cool <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/remakerspace">RemakerSpace</a>, a not-for-profit that offers fancy 3D printing, industrial sewing machines and a well equipped soldering workshop.
A few emails later and I got the okay to rock up and give it a bashðŸ˜Ž</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250604-143405.avif" /></p>
<p>The place is super well equipped, and Iâ€™m now presumably totally spoiled and will never be able to use less fancy equipmentðŸ¤·</p>
<p>The planets were sadly not on side this time and so I wasnâ€™t diligent about taking pictures whilst doing this, but hereâ€™s the unadorned PCB:</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250604-143554.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250604-143631.avif" width="49%" /></p>
<p>And hereâ€™s the finished PCB in all itâ€™s glory:</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250604-143715.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250604-143747.avif" width="49%" /></p>
<p>I didnâ€™t burn myself, set anything on fire or die and I even had fun, so I regard it as a great success!</p>
<p>I also had no way of knowing if I screwed anything up at the time since I didnâ€™t realise the controller board had a wretched micro-USB port, which I (obviously) didnâ€™t think to bring, and so chose to roll with unjustified confidence through it assuming it would work.
Soldering the LEDs and resistors on the back was definitely the hardest bit as itâ€™s the most fiddly.
Iâ€™m sure there were tools in there that could have helped (probably those funky helping hands on the multimeter in the pic of the setup above), but I was alone and was too shy to mess around with stuff too muchðŸ˜…</p>
<p>Now it was just a case of removing the rubbish original board:</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250604-144540.avif" /></p>
<p>And installing the shiny new one without breaking the scary ribbon cables:</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250604-144842.avif" style="transform:rotate(270deg);" /></p>
<p>And after some tense firmware flashing it worked!!!</p>
<p><img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbGhzM3QxMHc5YTV2eWlndG4ybDI0dnR0a3VpNHc3YTIybDc4M25rbSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/VdiQKDAguhDSi37gn1/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>To perhaps little surprise it seems the LEDs donâ€™t actually work (maybe I installed them wrong way aroundðŸ˜…), but who needs that junk anyway!
The only other issue Iâ€™ve noticed is that it takes a strangely long time to start working on my Mac from sleep, but itâ€™s only a few seconds so I donâ€™t much care and have been too lazy to investigate for now.</p>
<p>For the curious hereâ€™s my current keymap on the <a href="https://config.qmk.fm/">QMK configurator</a>:</p>
<p><img src="index-img/250604-150052.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250604-150412.avif" width="49%" /><img src="index-img/250604-150431.avif" width="49%" /></p>
<p>I had loads of fun doing this and would highly recommend as a first soldering project to the 3 people this might be relevant for :P</p>
