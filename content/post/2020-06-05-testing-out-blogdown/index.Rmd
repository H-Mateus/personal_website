# Hello world!
This is my very first blog post using an R Markdown file within blogdown.

The other blog posts on this site came with the template, but I'm leaving them there for now as they are great introductory resources for R Markdown, Hugo and the Academic template. 

This post (and this whole site!) wouldn't be possible without the excellent teaching material from [Dr. Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/), and the lovely people who made R and her many brilliant packages for which I offer all the gratitude I can muster!

For practice, I'm going to demonstrate how we can include the following in a single post:

1) R code
2) A plot
3) An image (via markdown syntax)
4) An image (via `knitr::include_graphics`)
5) A relative link to another section in my site
6) Reading in data

# 1) Iris data set
Let's make a plot using the `iris` data set in `ggplot2`.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Dataset
head(iris)
```


<br>

# 2) Plotting
```{r}
scatter <- ggplot(data=iris, aes(x= Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
scatter + geom_point(aes(color=Species, shape=Species)) +
  xlab("Sepal Length") + ylab("Sepal Width") +
  theme_bw()
```

<br>

# 3) Embedding a bundled image

Using markdown syntax `![Cute red panda](cute-red-panda-40.jpg)` to generate the image below:

<center> ![Cute red panda](cute-red-panda-40.jpg){width=500px} </center>

<br>

# 4) Using knitr

We can also accomplish this with a code chunk, setting the following parameter `out.width="500px", fig.align='center'`

(ref:caption-example) We can do nice auto-numbered captions as well!

```{r, fig.cap='(ref:caption-example)', out.width="500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("cute-red-panda-40.jpg")
```

<br>

# 5) Relative links 

I can also include some relative links to, for example, tell you to check out this [other section of my site](../../../../home/../)!

The structure of relative links is a bit confusing. 
When specifying the location of the page you want to get to, the reference point is the directory that your post lives in (and NOT the project root directory). 

<br>

# 6) Reading in data

Let's flex our R muscles a little more by reading in some topical data, and making a fancier plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
covid_deaths <- read_csv("covid_deaths_by_age_2020-06-05.csv")
# let's select the rows of actual data
covid_deaths_filtered <- covid_deaths[7:16,]
# set column names 
names(covid_deaths_filtered) <- c("age_group", 
                                  "non-covid_excess_mortality", 
                                  "covid_excess_mortality")
# convert to long-format dataframe
covid_deaths_long <- pivot_longer(covid_deaths_filtered, 
                                  -age_group, 
                                  names_to = "mortality_type", 
                                  values_to = "deaths")
# convert deaths to a numeric
covid_deaths_long$deaths <- as.numeric(covid_deaths_long$deaths)
# plot 
ggplot(covid_deaths_long, aes(x = age_group, y = deaths)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = mortality_type), 
           stat="identity", 
           position=position_dodge()) +
  ylab("Deaths registered per 100,000") +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.direction = "horizontal") +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "", 
                    labels = c("COVID-19 mortality rate", 
                               "Non-COVID-19 excess mortality rate"), 
                    values = c("tomato", "steelblue")) +
  labs(caption = "Source: Office for National Statistics")
```
