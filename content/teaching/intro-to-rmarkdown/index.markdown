This workshop was part of the [Researcher Summer school at Keele University 2022](https://www.keele.ac.uk/kiite/conferences/researchersummerschool/).

The session and accompanying website aims to provide a gentle introduction to using R Markdown, with a focus on scientific writing.

It also touches on the differences between R Markdown and the next-generation Quarto.
